  The Melbourne Open Research Network (MORN) is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers in Melbourne, Australia. It aims to facilitate the growth of Open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources. 
  </br>
  MORN is a member of the <a href="https://anzorn.netlify.com">Australia and New Zealand Open Research Network (ANZORN)</a>, a meta-organisation supporting Open Research activities throughout the region.

    description: > 
      The logo represents a whole community, made up of individual actors, who stand back to back in support of each other. The circle is open to reflect our want to welcome new members. The Logo is black and white because... Melbourne. It is expected that new member communities will adapt this logo to their own colour schemes.
