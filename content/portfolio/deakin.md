### Deakin Open Research Network

Deakin University is a young university spread across 4 campuses, in Burwood, Geelong, and Warnambool. The open research community at Deakin is primarily located at the Burwood campus and is eager to know open research advocates in the local area. 

We will be running a weekly "open science hacky hour" on the Burwood campus, so if you want to learn more about open research, find new ways to open up your work, or just want to meet some new people, let us know and come along. for details, please contact Mathew Ling at m.ling[at]deakin[dot]edu[dot]au or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lingtax).
